## Encountered problems
- How to restrict uploaded file format to accept image/* only with React File Base64 package? or is there any other simple way to encode images to base64 string? or maybe more efficient way to save images to server?
- Voting system uses localStorage to verify whether its upvoted, instead of checking by IP. This is probably something that needs to be improved in the feature.
